# EMS
A digital entry management system.  
Technology stack - Python, Django , HTML , CSS.  

## Approach-
0.The website is built using python django framework.
1.First I setup the dependencies for app and basic structure of the app.  
2.Then created django models.py(classes) which defines the schema of the website.  
3.This website uses sqlite3 database to store data.  
4.Then all the funtionalities of the app are implemented in the views.py.  
5.Mails can be sent via django's inbuilt backend mail and SMS's to specific numbers can be triggered by integrating Twillo's rest api.
